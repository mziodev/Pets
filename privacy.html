            <p>
                We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our

                locally on your device using SwiftData and synced with your
                iCloud account using iCloudKit. This means that all data remains
                under your control and is not transmitted to our servers or any
                third-party services.
            </p>

                As we do not collect or store any personal information, we do
                not have any measures in place to protect it. However, we
                recommend that you follow best practices to secure your device
                and iCloud account to protect your data.
            </p>

            <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                We do not share your information with third parties, as we do
                not collect any personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>
                Since we do not collect any personal information, you do not
                have any rights related to accessing, updating, or deleting your
                information. However, you can manage your data within the app
                and iCloud account at any time.

                We may update this policy from time to time. If we make
                significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by
                email.
            </p>
