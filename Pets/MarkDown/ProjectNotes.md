# Project Notes

## Resizable image
We need to implement a resizable function for pet images. Probably we need a new intermediate sheet view for selecting and resizing the photo. And it would be a good idea an alert message before deleting the existing image.


## Number of decimal digits after the dot
We hace to try changing the number of decimal digits from 2 to 3. 


## Pet icon color
Maybe we can try to color dog and cat icons differently no the main pet list.


## Localization and i18n
We have to do localization an internationalization of the entire app: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Indian... on this order. 
* Checkout: Text messages from alerts and empty views


<!--## Trim spaces
We need to trim all final and first blank spaces before save on the data base.-->
