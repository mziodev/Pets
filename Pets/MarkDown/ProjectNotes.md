# Project Notes

## Data base migration
We must to learn migrations before another model update.


## iPad
We have to adaptate the app to properly render on an iPad.


## Edit chip ID info
We can add an edit button to the chip ID sheet view. We could build a separate view for always editing the chip ID, with a navigation link from the petDetails view and an edit button in the sheet view.  


## Vaccines
- We need the date info on each row of expired vaccines.
- We need a notes box for vaccines.
- Starts and Ends instead of Date...
- Pickers 


## Localization and i18n
We have to do localization an internationalization of the entire app: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Indian... on this order.
* Checkout: Text messages from alerts and empty views.


## Resizable image
We need to implement a resizable function for pet images. Probably we need a new intermediate sheet view for selecting and resizing the photo. And it would be a good idea an alert message before deleting the existing image.
