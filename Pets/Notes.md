## Dog/Cat hair classification

**Length:**

- Hairless: None (completely hairless)
- Buzzed/Very short (less than 1/4 inch or 6 mm)
- Fluffy/Fine downy coat (about 1/4 inch or 6 mm)
- Short: Less than 1 inch (2.5 cm)
- Medium: 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm)
- Long: 3-6 inches (7.5-15 cm)
- Flowing/Extra Long: More than 6 inches (15 cm)

**Texture:**

- Fine: Soft, silky, and smooth to the touch
- Medium: Straight and smooth, but not as fine as fine coats
- Coarse: Thick and rough, with a dense undercoat
- Wiry: Harsh and wiry, with a dense undercoat
- Crinkled: Forms a wavy or crinkled texture

**Type:**

- Straight: Lies flat against the body, with no curl or wave
- Curly: Forms tight curls or waves
- Wavy: Forms loose waves or ripples
- Corded: Forms long, thin cords or mats
- Double: Has two distinct layers of fur, with a soft undercoat and a coarser outer coat

This classification system can be applied to both dogs and cats, and can help to describe the characteristics of their coats. For example:

* A Sphynx cat might be classified as having a Short, Fine coat with a Straight type.
* A Persian cat might be classified as having a Long, Fine coat with a Straight type.
* A Poodle dog might be classified as having a Medium, Curly coat with a Wiry texture.
* A Maine Coon cat might be classified as having a Medium, Coarse coat with a Double type.

Keep in mind that individual animals may have unique characteristics that don't fit neatly into one category, and this classification system is meant to be a general guide rather than a strict set of rules.

## Localization and i18n
- Localize JSON breed files to Spanish.

- We have to do localization and internationalization of the entire app on: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Indian... on this order.


## Data base migration
We must to learn migrations before another model update.


## Vaccines
- We need a notes box for vaccines.
- We need to store the cost? Or is included on the cost of consultation?
- Pickers


## Resizable image
We need to implement a resizable function for pet images. Probably we need a new intermediate sheet view for selecting and resizing the photo. And it would be a good idea an alert message before deleting the existing image.


## iPad (waiting for iOS 18)
We have to adaptate the app to properly render on an iPad.


## Future features
### Food control:
- Food brand, quantity, cost, shop link.
- Food per day.

### Vet data
