## Localization and i18n
- We have to do localization and internationalization of the entire app on: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Indian... on this order.


## Resizable image
We need to implement a resizable function for pet images. Probably we need a new intermediate sheet view for selecting and resizing the photo. And it would be a good idea an alert message before deleting the existing image.


## Sharing data with other iCloud users

- Maybe it's possible merging SwiftData and CoreData.
